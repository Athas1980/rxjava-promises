## Documentation

### Creating a Promise

Either use the constructor or the defer() static method

```java
Promise<String> p1 = Promise.defer();
Promise<String> p2 = new Promise<>();
````

### then()

To add a new action to a promise that is invoked when it is fulfilled, you may use the then(onFulfilled) function.

```java
p1.then(new PromiseAction<String>() {
  public void call(String value) {
    // do something with String value
  }
});

p1.then(new PromiseFunction<String, String>() {
  public String call(String value) {
    // do something with String value and return a String
    return value.toUpperCase();
  }
});

p1.then(new RepromiseFunction<String, String>() {
  public Promise<String> call(String value) {
    // do something with String value and return another Promise for a String
    Promise<String> result = Promise.defer():
    ...
    return result;
  }
});
````

To detect when a promise is rejected (or an error occurs), using then(onFulfilled, onRejected).

```java
p1.then(new PromiseAction<String>() {
  public void call(String value) {
    // do something with String value
  }
}, new PromiseAction<Exception>() {
  public void call(Exception reason) {
    // recover from the error
  }
});
````

### fail()

As a convenience, you may use fail(onRejected).

```java
p1.fail(new PromiseAction<Exception>() {
  public void call(Exception reason) {
    // recover from the error
  }
});
````

### finally

Finally is a non-spec feature for promises. It is invoked immediately after the promiseÂ is fulfilled
or rejected. Just call fin(onFinally).

```java
p1.fin(new FinallyAction() {
  public void call() {
    // cleanup 
  }
});

p1.fin(new FinallyFunction<String>() {
  public Promise<String> call() {
    // returning a promise will delay the chain of promises until it is fulfilled
    return new Promise<String>();
  }
});
````

### fulfill() / reject()

Fulfilling or Rejecting a promise is straightforward.

```java
// fulfilling a promise
p1.fulfill("So Long");

// rejecting
p1.reject("And thanks for all the fish.");
````

## Implementing a different Language

To implement Promises in a JVM Language of your choice, you should write a subclass implementation of 
com.darylteo.rx.promises.AbstractPromise. Implement the 3 functions (and any overloads) as required: 

 - then
 - fail
 - finally

View an example in the 
[java](java/src/main/java/com/darylteo/rx/promises/java/Promise.java) 
and [groovy](groovy/src/main/groovy/com/darylteo/rx/promises/groovy/Promise.groovy) 
implementations.

## Java vs Other Languages

### Java 
As you can see from the code above, while Promises offers a solution to "callback hell", its usage in Java
is still rather verbose, and due to the type-safe nature of Java, there are a couple of rules that must be followed:

 - when using both onFulfilled and onRejected, you must always return the same return-type as its handler will 
 be expecting a single class. If, for some reason, you absolutely must allow for different return types, you 
 should then use a container class, or a common superclass.
 - if calling fail(), you may not change the return type. The fulfilled value will be passed through the chain
 which will still be expecting the same data type.

There are also several handler implementations available for convenience to Java users.

### Other Languages

If you are using a different language implementation (for example, Groovy), you will be able to sacrifice 
the type-safety of your code to avoid that limitation. The amount of convenience that is awarded is determined by:

 - support for dynamic typing
 - "first-class" functions (or closures, lambdas, delegates etc.)

For example, in Groovy, your code should look more like this:

```groovy
aPromiseReturningFunction()
.then { result ->
  return result.toUpperCase()
}
.then { result ->
  return result[6..11]
}
.fail { error ->
  return 'World'
}
.then { result ->
  println result
}
````

Keep your ears open for new language implementations in the future!
